"""gamemaster.py

A simple game master program for Simplified Backgammon.

To use this program, edit the import statements below to import your
preferred playing agents, and set the time limit per move.

Then run the program under Python 3.x from a command line:
python3 gamemaster.py

The rules of the game are simplified for this version of Backgammon.
A. WHITE always plays first, so there is no initial rolling and
   requirement that the first player use the initial roll.
B. No doubling allowed. "Cube value" is therefore always 1.
C. A player may pass on any turn, in either of two ways:
     -- Pass on the whole turn.
     -- Pass on moving a second checker.
D. If no move is available to a player on its turn, then it MUST pass
   or forfeit the game.  If it can move only one checker, then it
   should do that and pass for the second checker.
E. If the dice come out doubles (like a pair of sixes), then unlike
   standard backgammon, where the player can move 4 checkers, we
   don't allow any special bonus.
F. Standard backgammon has a rule that if a player can only use one
   of the two dice, the player must use the larger number.  We do not
   follow that rule.  Either number may be used.
G. No special rules are in effect, like the Crawford rule, since
   we don't use the doubling cube.

This game master is very strict, in terms of requiring that the
playing agents describe legal moves.  If the game master detects
anything wrong with a player's move, the game ends and the player
with the questionable move forfeits the game.

Time limits are not implemented so just ignored in this version.

Includes a feature in deterministic mode that checks for 3 passes in
a row (no changes to the state except change of whose turn 3 times).
If this happens, the game is terminated and declared to be a tie.

Last updated April 24, 2020, to fix the checking whether moves exist
when a player passes.

Helpful notes on reading this code:
A "move" is a string that indicates the position of the checkers to be
moved and it is split into up to 3 parts: the position of the first checker
to be moved, the postion of the second checker to be moved, and
potentially a third "reverse" command.
So, '6,9' would mean that the checker at index 6 will be moved, followed by
the checker at index 9 which is moved next. To determine how far they
will move, look at the dice roll: the first dice is applied to the first
checker and the second dice roll is applied to the second checker.
So if we have move = '6,9' and dice = [1, 6] then the end positions of the
two checkers would be 7 and 15 (derived from 6+1 and 9+6 respectively).

In a move command, there are a few special characters:
1. 'p', which can replace an indices of a checker. It means that checker
"passes", aka it ignores the corresponding dice roll and doesn't move.
Ex. '6,p' given the roll [1, 6] results in the first checker moving to 7
but no other change (so the second roll of 6 is dropped).

2. 'q', which means quit. Primarily a user inputted command (your player
should never quit), this means the player gives up and wants to exit the game.

3. 'r', flips the values of the dice, so that the first checker is moved by
the second dice roll  and the second checker is moved by
the first dice roll.
Ex. to compute move '10,4,r' with dice rolls [1, 6], we compute that the
checker at position 10 gets +6 and the checker at position 4 gets +1, so the
final result of '10,4,r' + rolls [1,6] will be checkers at positions 16 and 5.

**IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL**
2. Again, note that to compute 'r', the dice values are flipped, NOT the checker positions.
Consider '8,7,r' with [1,6] and '7,8' with [1,6] (aka we flipped the checker positions
instead than the dice values like we were supposed to):
In '8,7,r' with [1,6], the checker at 8 gets +6, then the checker at 7 gets +1, so
we have final positions (14, 8).
In '7,8' with [1,6], the checker at 7 gets +1, then the checker at 8 gets +6.
So we might get (8, 14) if there were two checkers that moved, which is the opposite
of what we wanted. Additionally, in this case specifically, the second checker at 8
could be the same checker as the first! 7 goes to 8, then goes to 14. So with this case
(but not the other!), the checker at 7 could've have moved twice. So '7,8' with [1,6]
does not require 2 distinct checkers, while '8,7,r' with [1,6] does.
So to handle 'reverse', be sure to flip dice values, NOT checker positions.

1. There is duplicate methods in this class and in genmoves.py. Some of the methods
in genmoves.py do not seem to be the finished versions (as they were slightly different
from the original code in this method), but I don't know which to keep.
