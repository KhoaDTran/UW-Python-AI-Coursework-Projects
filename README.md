# UW-Python-AI-Coursework-Projects
## Coursework and projects regarding data programming and artificial intelligence in Python at the University of Washington

### Introduction to Artificial Intelligence:
Examines concepts, principles, and programming techniques of artificial intelligence in Python, along with concepts of symbol manipulation, knowledge representation, logical and probabilistic reasoning, learning, language understanding, vision, expert systems, and social issues. Lab and coursework provide knowledge in concepts described above.

### Intermediate Data Programming:
Exploration of topics related to data programming, more specifically, composing programs that manipulate various data types, leveraging the ecosystem of tools and libraries related to data programming in Python. The final project is an application examining differences in various streaming services as well as imposing a machine learning library to predict future streaming service availability of different T.V. shows or movies based on genre, production crew, and much more.
